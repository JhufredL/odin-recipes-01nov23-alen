  <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 360°F. 30 minutes before preparation.</li>
    <li>Prepare a frying pan over medium heat, previously heating the oil for 3 min. and making a sauce with the garlic, paprika, onion and tomato. Add the crumbled MAGGI® rib cube and cook for 2 min. Add the meat and cook for 5 min. stirring constantly, adding 1 1/2 cups of water until it boils and the meat is cooked</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pass the pasticho paste through 1 cup of warm water so that it does not break when you assemble it.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Bechamel sauce by placing the CARNATION® Evaporated Milk in a small pot. Add the parmesan cheese, the flour, along with the margarine and nutmeg. Bring it to the heat, stirring constantly until it reaches the desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste. Then, remove it and set it aside.</li>
    <li>In the floured mold, place a layer of pasta, then one of meat, one of Bechamel sauce and one of mozzarella cheese. Repeat this sequence until you finish with all the ingredients. Of course, make sure that the last layer is pasta and Bechamel sauce.</li>
    <li>Finally, sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Place the mold in the oven to bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until melted. Remove carefully and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy your pastiche!</li>
